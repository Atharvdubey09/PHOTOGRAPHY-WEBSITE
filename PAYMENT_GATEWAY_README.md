## 🔄 **Integration Workflow**

1. **User books session** → Booking created with 'pending' status
2. **Payment gateway opens** → User sees advance amount breakdown
3. **Payment processed** → Token generated, booking status → 'confirmed'
4. **Confirmation email** → User receives booking confirmation
5. **Session day** → Remaining amount collected in-person

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

- **Payment Tokens** - Unique tokens for each transaction
- **No Card Storage** - Card details never saved to database
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive form validation
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failure management
- **Audit Trail** - Payment attempt logging
