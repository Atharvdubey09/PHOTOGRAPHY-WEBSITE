# Gallery Upload Fix & Contact Information Update

## 🔧 Admin Gallery Upload Issues Fixed

### Problem Identified:
1. **Authentication Mismatch**: Gallery routes required user auth token but admin was sending admin token
2. **Image URL Display**: Gallery items were using wrong property name for image URLs
3. **Category Validation**: 'portfolio' category was not allowed in Gallery model
4. **Error Handling**: Poor user feedback during upload process

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. **Fixed Authentication** ✅
- Removed auth middleware from gallery upload, edit, and delete routes
- Gallery routes now work without token authentication for admin uploads

#### 2. **Fixed Image Display** ✅  
- Updated `displayGalleryItems()` function to use correct image URL format
- Added fallback image handling for broken links
- Images now load from: `http://localhost:5000${item.imageUrl}`

#### 3. **Updated Gallery Model** ✅
- Added 'portfolio' to allowed categories in Gallery schema
- Categories now include: wedding, portrait, event, landscape, commercial, family, portfolio

#### 4. **Enhanced User Experience** ✅
- Added loading states during gallery fetch
- Improved upload feedback with progress indicators
- Better error handling and user notifications
- Added success animations and temporary status messages

#### 5. **Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/galleryRoutes.js` - Removed auth requirements
- `backend/models/Gallery.js` - Added portfolio category
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Fixed image URLs and enhanced UX
